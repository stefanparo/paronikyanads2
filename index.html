			<p><b>What is the foreign exchange market (forex)?</b></p>
			<p>Have you ever travelled to a different country and <strong>exchanged</strong> money to the currency of your destination? Well you my friend, have influenced the markets by tiny amount and could be the reason of a trend reversal or even a continuation. See the concept of the <strong>foreign exchange</strong> market is quite simple, you buy price of the currency goes up or down you sell and either make a loss or a gain, or it could be the other way around, you can sell and buy later when the market has moved. The complicated bit lies in predicting how when and why the movement happens.</p>
			<p>The <strong>forex market</strong> is hugeee. $5 trillion switch hand’s <strong>every day</strong>. Yes, that’s a 5 with 12 0’s at the end with 4 commas, thats <strong>5,000,000,000,000.</strong></p>
			<center><img src="average-daily-trading-volume1.png" alt="Trulli" width="525" height="322"></center>
			<p>This is what the forex market looks like compared to the other markets like, New York Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and London Stock Exchange.The forex market is OVER 200 TIMES BIGGER!!! Its so huge that us retail day traders are only 5% - 6% of the total volume of the markets or between $300million – $400million.</p>
			
			<p>The forex market is open 24 hours a day for 5 days a week closing for the weekend. slackers am I right? But still, 5 days is completely enough to catch a few pips and make a profit. <strong>Pips</strong> are just points we use to measure the change in the market, for example, If EUR/USD moves from 1.1050 to 1.1051, that .0001 USD rise in value is ONE PIP.</p>

			<br><p><b>So how dose one trade on the forex markets?</b></p>

			<p>Well simply, you nee a little bit of money, a broker and a device to be trading on, also you need to be 18. A broker is someone who holds your money and gives you access to different platforms to allow you to buy and sell a currency pair or any other instrument available.</p>
			
			
			<p>The top 10 brokers we advise you to use:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>1) IG</li>
				<li>2) CMC MARKETS</li>
				<li>3) OANDA</li>
				<li>4) LONDON CAPITAL GROUP (LCG)</li>
				<li>5) X-TRADE BROKERS (XTB)</li>
				<li>6) FOREX.COM</li>
				<li>7) PEPPERSTONE</li>
				<li>8) IC MARKETS</li>
				<li>9) VANTAGE</li>
				<li>10) BDSWISS (TRY TO USE THIS ONE AS A LAST RESORT)</li>
				</ul>

			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p><b>what is spread?</b></p>
			<p><strong>spread</strong> is the differnce between the bid and ask price. The <strong>bid</strong> price is the price at which you can <strong>sell</strong> the currency. The <strong>ask</strong> price is the price at which you can <strong>buy</strong> the currency.
